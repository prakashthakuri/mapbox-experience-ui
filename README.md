# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Initial React Setup using Vite
Installing required dependencies
Creating a component called polygon which integrates the Map from MapBox
Creating a polygon on the MapBox

Installing Chakra-ui for the UI library, specially for buttons. ( Note: the reason I am using this is because I have not used Chakra-ui so wanted to give a try.)
